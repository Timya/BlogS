> A guy loves mess-up with everything that he wasn't discovered, touched. A mixture of contradictions. As a idealist he always living in da dream, fancy about the world of pretence that he could imagines with a smile. As a realist, he sticks with rules and baseline with no compromise. He is just a kid, living young, living with hope, the hope to reach his Zihuatanejo.
